# Modelling of Stochastic Processes class project

## Description

The goal of the project was to explore the problem of a parallel parking lot, where car lengths are random and come from a distribution with a finite first moment. We want to find a following limit:
lim(x→∞) ⁡N(x)/x
where:
x - distance from the beginning of the parking lot
N - number of parked cars from the beginning of the parking lot up to x

## Content

There is a .ipynb file with all the code to run.
Apart from that you can also check the full documentation and a poster (both in polish) with results and figures.
